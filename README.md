Dear,

The IDL's implementation of MSDC and SVM integrated with stochastic distances between scaled Complex Multivariate Wishart distributions for PolSAR data classification is available here.

A very simple user interface was built in order to better acomodate the implementations and provide a compiled/end-user version. This implementation is in the rbc4polsar.zip file.

Furthermore, the datasets (images, segmentations as training/test samples) used in the original paper experiments are available at: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1y53IoS4c7Ig2aQrL3Mgt3xMZRRn-j-L8

Best,
The authors.
